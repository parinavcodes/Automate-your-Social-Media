# Automate-your-Social-Media
The Application is developed on Python, and can be used to schedule posts to a user’s social media accounts. It primarily encapsulates two different access domains.<br/>
• The first, uses a varied range of tools including Selenium and JavaScript and can be used on
personal fronts.<br/>
• The second, uses an API to execute the tasks. Since, a deeper level of security is incorporated in this
methodology, this tool can be used at public levels.

soc_poster.py uses selenium in python to execute the tasks, and api_soc_poster uses API to do the same.
